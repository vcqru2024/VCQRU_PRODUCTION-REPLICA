                                    spurious of counterfeit of the original product . It does not comment on the quality
                                    of the product .</li>
                                                    <li>The product genuineness inquiry services utilise use of a scratch label pasted on
                                    the product with precoding at your ( manufacturer) end. The codes on the scratch
                                    labels are sent by user to command center for verification. The system works on
                                    the premise that the fake/counterfeit/spurious/duplicate product producers can not
                                    economically produce fakes/counterfeit/spurious/duplicate products without purchasing
                                    an original genuine product as they will not be able to match the codes on the scratch
                                    labels. However, in one event when the codes of scratch label of a genuine original
                                    product without verification are used on duplicate/fake/counterfeit/spurious product,
                                    then the same may get passed from the system . Hence, fake product can pass through
                                    the system only when one original product is purchased by fake producers. However
                                    , this can not be done for many product due to economic loss to duplicate/fake/counterfeit
                                    /spurious producers as they have to buy one original for one duplicate. The fake
                                    manufacturers will not setup their production facility at huge cost to produce without
                                    knowing correct codes. The user fully understands this and accepts this while using
