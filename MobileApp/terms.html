                <li>LABEL 9420 shall provide you ("User") method and enabling mechanism through its
                  website, printed labels and services so that purchasers of your product ( consumers)
                  on their own through LABEL9420Product genuineness inquiry related servicescan obtain
                  details inter alia, genuineness of product, name of product, name of manufacturer
                  , Maximum retail price (MRP), date of manufacturing, date of expiry, batch number
                  , message from manufacturerthroughout India ("Service/s or LABEL9420 Services").
                  These Services may be availed by the User in India at any time during the year based
                  on details offered by you.</li>
                <li>LABEL9420 provides Users a facility to know if the product they have purchased is
                  actually manufactured by the Manufacturer it claims or it is a fake, duplicate,
                  spurious of counterfeit of the original product . It does not comment on the quality
                  of the product .</li>
                <li>The product genuineness inquiry services utilise use of a scratch label pasted on
                  the product with precoding at your ( manufacturer) end. The codes on the scratch
                  labels are sent by user to command center for verification. The system works on
                  the premise that the fake/counterfeit/spurious/duplicate product producers can not
                  economically produce fakes/counterfeit/spurious/duplicate products without purchasing
                  an original genuine product as they will not be able to match the codes on the scratch
                  labels. However, in one event when the codes of scratch label of a genuine original
                  product without verification are used on duplicate/fake/counterfeit/spurious product,
                  then the same may get passed from the system . Hence, fake product can pass through
                  the system only when one original product is purchased by fake producers. However
                  , this can not be done for many product due to economic loss to duplicate/fake/counterfeit
                  /spurious producers as they have to buy one original for one duplicate. The fake
                  manufacturers will not setup their production facility at huge cost to produce without
                  knowing correct codes. The user fully understands this and accepts this while using
                  the services.</li>
