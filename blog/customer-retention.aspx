                            <img src="../NewContent/front-assets/img/blog/loyalty-program.jpg" alt="Blog Img">
                            <p class="card-text">By now it is a well-understood concept that maintaining existing
                                clients is less expensive and more profitable than acquiring new ones.
                                This is further reasoned with a statistic from Accenture that states that 57% of
                                consumers spend more on brands to which they are loyal. Therefore,
                                a customer is more likely to be associated with your brand for the long term if you
                                engage them in some sort of loyalty program which benefits them.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                This will eventually increase your conversion rate on customer retention parameters.
                                Going with this premise, VCQRU identifies the accelerating trend
                                of mitigating your loyal clients from turning to the competition and maximizing the
                                lifetime of a customer by offering them tangible encouragement into
                                repeating their purchase.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                A successful loyalty program is a win-win situation for a brand and VCQRU not just makes
                                it a necessity but also promotes it through various schemes.
                                We help businesses generate more revenue while staying on our toes for the highest
                                quality customer service.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                With cut-throat competition in the global world, managing one’s business online and
                                offline tends to be overwhelming. VCQRU enters this domain with cutting-edge technology
                                and a pool of
                                creativity to offer your business to retain customers</p>
                            <h5 class="card-title">Allow us to walk you through the VCQRU methods in a loyalty program
                                that retain
                                customers-</h5>

                                <li>01. Personalization throughout the customer journey</li>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                    VCQRU uses the customer loyalty program to use relevant information of customers and
                                    personalize their experience throughout the buying journey. For example, when you
                                    have some existing clients and their basic details such as preferences, buying
                                    patterns, you can use this information to turn it into a tangible benefit for both
                                    the brand and the client.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                    To add cherry to the personalized concept, while customers respond well to this
                                    factor, it creates satisfaction among the clients who would come back to feel
                                    special. This can be understood by the example of Nykaa that stores your information
                                    on skin tone, skin type, makeup preferences and in turn offers you a tailored
                                    solution through searches. Demonstrating that you identify your customer's choices
                                    and understand them makes a huge difference in retaining them.
                                </p>
                                <li>02. Makes the Customer Journey and Experience Streamlined</li>
                                <p class="card-text">One of the most vital aspects and benefits of a loyalty program is
                                    that it streamlines the buying journey of a customer.
                                    For example, once you have all the basic details of your customer, all you would
                                    need during the checkout process is a customer click on
                                    the buy button. Imagine how easy it would be for a client and they would love the
                                    buying experience.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                    To make it more exciting, brands would offer you points or perks upon completing a
                                    purchase and every time you write a review or make payment through the app. This is
                                    followed by famous brands such as Starbucks, where a loyal client will not require
                                    to stand in long queues and just pay through the app with a quick click.
                                </p>
                                <li>03 Delights Customers</li>
                                <p class="card-text">Delighting your loyal or prive customers hold the key to retaining
                                    them.
                                    Now, delighting would not necessarily mean to entertain them always. It would also
                                    mean
                                    to send them a surprise gift on their birthday or occasionally offer them additional
                                    treats
                                    on the purchase of a certain amount.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                    Amazon is a great example that offers one day delivery of goods and services and
                                    endless streaming rights to the prime members. A loyal customer can be delighted in
                                    various ways if you pay attention to what your brand stands for and what are your
                                    offerings. You can focus on the mode or channel you are using as a selling medium
                                    and make use of that to delight and surprise your loyal customers to keep them from
                                    moving to your competition.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                    The most important part is that if you have an idea to delight your loyal clients,
                                    go ahead with it. Just because a concept is not being implemented already, does not
                                    mean it will not work!
                                </p>

                                A loyalty program stands for trust and a strong bond. When you identify your client's
                                needs and address them with your products and services without their intervention, the
                                act creates a level of trust and helps to retain them, for long.
                            </p>

                                it creates a relationship between clients and businesses through listening to the
                                customers, asking for their feedback and implementing their suggestions wherever
                                required.

                                While you ask for preferences, feedback and suggestions from your clients in the form of

                                improvement.

                                As your loyal customers, they're more likely to fill the form or survey and say the
                                truth about your brand. Looking closely, you can use this information to fill the
                                loopholes and create a better browsing and buying experience for your loyal customers.
                                This strategy also helps in spreading information about the brand through word of mouth
                                which in turn brings new clients.
