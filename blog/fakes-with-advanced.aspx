                                <p class="card-text"> The counterfeiting of products is a global problem that affects
                                    brands, consumers, and economies. In a report published by the Organization for
                                    Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), counterfeit products are valued at USD
                                    509 billion annually. And as per Forbes report the total amount of counterfeit goods
                                    sold each year comes in at around $1.7 trillion to $4.5 trillion.</p>
                                <p class="card-text"> Consumers may be harmed by counterfeit products, which are often
                                    of inferior quality and may not meet safety requirements.
                                    The primary objective of anti-counterfeiting solutions is to identify genuine
                                    products quickly and reliably. In counterfeit goods, cheap, substandard, and
                                    dangerous components are used, putting consumers' health and safety at risk.</p>
